196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Sol1:

DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;


Sol2: Much faster

DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN (
    SELECT email, MIN(id) AS min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) p2
ON p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.min_id;
