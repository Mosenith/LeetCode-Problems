197. Rising Temperature

Sol1: Using DataDiff

SELECT w1.id
FROM
    Weather AS w1
    JOIN Weather AS w2
        ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;


Sol2: Using SubDate

SELECT w1.id
FROM
    Weather AS w1
    JOIN Weather AS w2
        ON SUBDATE(w1.recordDate, 1) = w2.recordDate AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;


Reason:

The DATEDIFF() function could also be used to calculate the difference between the two dates,
but this would be less efficient because the DATEDIFF() function needs to calculate the difference
between the two dates in days, even though we only need to know whether the difference is one day.

In general, it is best to use the SUBDATE() function when you need to calculate a date that is a
specific number of days before or after the current date.
The DATEDIFF() function is more general and can be used to calculate the difference between any two dates.
